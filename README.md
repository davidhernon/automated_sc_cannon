# This Is No Longer Under Development
It was a hacky experiment to see if I could make a DIY Soundcloud Location search to find bands in a certain city. Ill keep the code up because its fun to look back but it is of horrific code quality :)

Iirc, this project tries to scrape every users metadata. It does a bunch of stupid stuff by building a new directory, cloning an entire github project and then trying to get users metadata for a certain range of user ids

I ran as many concurrent copies of this script as I could and after about 8 hours I tripped up SoundClouds DNS prevention measures and got the IP blacklisted. My roommates who were streaming music on their own machines were really confused and a little upset :)
